# VHLtexts
Italian texts encoded in XML and annotated as part of the VHL project in Italian Studies at Brown University

**Boccaccio-Esposizioni**
**Villani-Cronica**
Both encoded in XML and have accompanying file with annotations in it. Annotations are linked to spans within the text.

**Pico-Conclusiones**
Live project is here: 
http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/pico/
The folder contains 2 documents, one in Latin and a translation in Spanish. They line up by paragraph number. The working project is using a database, and there appear to be more annotations than just the translation. Not many, but they are more like notes. These are also attached to paragraphs. However, we may have to export the db to find them. 

**Pico-Oratio**
This document has three parallel texts, in Latin, English and Italian. It also has several levels of annotation which are marked in the text. I can't find the file with the annotations yet. However the project is live in the following:
http://cds.library.brown.edu/projects/vlab/ (although the annotation links are not working, perhaps because it's not pointing to the correct db.)
The original version is here:
http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/pico/text/ov.html

The sections listed on the TOC page have 4 levels of annotation:
 1. The Latin text (always on the left) has lettered and numbered annotations
 2. The Italian text has numbered annotations
 3. The English text has numbered annotations, where they exist, and they are translations of the Italian annotations, so should match up.
These annotations are attached to random points within the text.
